# Surface-Vessel Nautical-Behaviour Analysis

## Introduction

The repository provides functionalities for nautical behaviour analysis. Including functionalities for:

- decoding AIS messages
- trajecory assembly from AIS messages
- segmentation of trajectories
- cleaning and smoothing of trajectories
- interpolation
- nautical behaviour analysis:
    - trajectory Clustering of spatiotemporal features
    - traffic flow modelling
    - creation of grid based spatiotemporal feature maps

## Requirements

To install all the requirements, one needs to first install:
- conda
- poetry

A detailed list of the required libraries can be found in:
-  poetry.toml

The proper installation must then be done with poetry and conda.
